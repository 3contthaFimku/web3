# Pinata Submarining

Pinata is built on [[notes/ipfs]]

## Submarining

This seems to be an attempt to have private content on IPFS ... but afaict they just do this by encrypting the content on IPFS and then you need the central pinata service to unlock it ... 

But once you have gone down this route why not just put your encrypted stuff on s3 in a public bucket?
