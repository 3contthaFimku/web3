So ... imagine this was simply a company

* It sells share to investors ...
* It uses the money to fund removal projects
* It accumulates plastic removal credits (PRCs) which are proof of plastic removal
* It sells those to companies or others who want to see plastic removed who retire them

Why does it need to be on blockchain? Other than this is a place you can (currently) raise (incredible amounts of) money from investors (in an unregulated way) ...
