FTX was a centralized crypto exchange founded in 2019 by [[Sam Bankman-Fried]] and headquartered in the Bahamas. There was also a US exchange FTX US. FTX and associated entities filed for bankruptcy on 11 Nov 2022. It had been one of the leading and more "blue-chip" crypto exchanges and played a leading role in bail-outs of other firms which had collapsed earlier in 2022.

Serum’s total market value was $88mn on Saturday, according to data provider CryptoCompare, suggesting FTX’s holdings would be worth far less if sold into the market. CryptoCompare’s figures take into account the coin’s liquidity.
