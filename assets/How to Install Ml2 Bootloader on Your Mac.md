## What is Ml2 Bootloader?
 
Ml2 Bootloader is a bootloader that allows you to boot macOS on a non-Apple hardware. A bootloader is a program that runs before the operating system and loads it into the memory. Without a bootloader, your Mac would not be able to start up and run macOS.
 
Ml2 Bootloader is based on the Chameleon project, which is one of the oldest and most widely used bootloaders for hackintoshes. Ml2 Bootloader inherits many features and improvements from Chameleon, such as graphics injection, custom resolutions, theme support, and more. Ml2 Bootloader also adds some new features and fixes some bugs that are specific to macOS.
 
## Why Use Ml2 Bootloader?

Ml2 Bootloader can help you achieve all these goals and more. It is easy to install and use, and it can support a wide range of hardware configurations. It can also coexist with other bootloaders such as Clover or OpenCore, so you can switch between them as you wish.
