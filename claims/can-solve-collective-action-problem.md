# Analysis

## KlimaDAO Case Study

This analysis initially focused primarily on KlimaDAO as a means of solving the the collective action problem of climate change. Take a look at our initial [evaluation of KliaDAO as a means of solving climate change](/notes/collective-action-problems-and-climate-change.md) and our follow on [deep dive conversation with KlimaDAO](https://web3.lifeitself.org/notes/in-conversation-with-klimadao-part-one) themselves for our full analysis of the project.

## Evaluating Web3's Ability to Solve the Public Goods Problem

We have also released a more expansive analysis of [web3 as a solution to the public goods problem](/claims/can-solve-public-goods-problem) which, given this is the most relevant form collective action problem faced by humanity, also acts as an analysis of this claim.
