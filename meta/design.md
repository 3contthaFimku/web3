# Issue Tree

* [x] How rough and ready are we in process and hence appearance? **✅2022-03-11 publish early, publish often and accept being "rougher" though flagging what is polished and not. - see [how-rough-and-ready](how-rough-and-ready.md)**
* [ ] Do we need to distinguish claims from aspirations from debates from questions people have?
* [ ] Are questions vs hypotheses a better way to frame (or even more attractive on the internet)
  * Questions seem less polarizing: Crypto will transform the world ... vs Can Crypto transform the world?
    * In a proper thesis setup where everyone understands we are dealing in claims and examining them and brings a rigorous open-mindedness then theses are better because can be evaluated ...
    * But we can always turn a claim into a question and vice-versa ...
    * Hypotheses are more accurate than claims but a bit more obscure in terminology
  * H: (70%) use questions rather than claims/hypotheses
* [x] Do we call ourselves "Making sense of Web3" or "Making sense of Crypto and Web3" or "Making Sense of Crypto" **✅2022-03-11 Making sense of crypto and web3**
  * [x] Do we mention Crypto at all? ✅ **Yes, crypto is more widespread and even less controversial in definition so definitely want to mention it**
