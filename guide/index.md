# Introduction

A broad range of claims are being made about the potential of blockchain technology. We have engaged in a project of[ rigorous research and analysis](https://coggle.it/diagram/Yh-L7j5DfRykGi7e/t/web3-what-is-the-evaluation-polarizing-way-as-possible) in order to make sense of these claims. We have spoken with technologists, economists, computer scientists, crypto skeptics and crypto enthusiasts in order to understand what is being claimed, what are the high level aspirations these claims speak to, do these claims hold up to scrutiny, what are the risks associated with the claims, and are there alternative options? It is important that we, as collectives of individuals, organizations, and society more broadly, make good choices about this emerging technology. We must decide whether to support, improve or curb it, how to allocate our resources effectively, and how we can make these decisions and take action in a constructive, intersectional and depolarizing way. 

The culmination of our sense-making effort is an easy-to-read guide in order to help facilitate the informed and wise decision-making needed. Below you will find a resource bank of aspirations and associated claims being made about crypto and web3. The guide has been organized by aspirations. Under each aspiration can be found the associated claim(s) with a brief description of the claim and our evaluation, links to content we have created digging into the claim, a list of related concepts, a list of associated FAQs and a Zotero Library for further reading.

# Aspiration 1: A more stable, more efficient, and more transparent economy


## Claim: Blockchain technology can facilitate the reduction of state intervention in the money supply 


### Description

This section contains information relating to the claim that Bitcoin can be the next gold standard. Those making this claim argue that the gold standard is good because government/central bank intervention in the money supply will inevitably lead to inflation, which is harmful to the free market and commerce.

According to advocates of Bitcoin as the new gold standard, Bitcoin shares the features of gold which make it a good choice to use as a currency, but also has additional features which make it an even better choice than gold for a currency.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation of this claim is that Bitcoin as a new gold standard would not achieve a more stable, more efficient economy: 



* the gold standard is inherently deflationary and moderate inflation is far preferable; 
* the flexibility offered by the ability for governments/central banks to intervene is highly useful; 
* the gold standard can lead to the reverberation of shocks through the global economy; 
* there are ways to democratize the fiat system without returning to gold; 
* unlike gold, Bitcoin has no potential as a store of value due to its inherent hypervolatility
* Bitcoin, unlike traditional commodities, has a negative price elasticity of demand. For this reason, Bitcoin looks like a speculative bubble, which at some point will inevitably crash.
* Bitcoin does not share gold’s uniquness due to the emergence of many ‘alternative coins’.

## Claim: Blockchain based financial innovation will create more efficient markets


### Description

This claim argues that we are evolving towards a 24/7 real-time, always-trading international market with greater complexity and lower friction than at present and that crypto is the next step in this evolution.

According to the capitalist notion that greater [financialization](https://web3.lifeitself.us/claims/is-hyperfinancialization) is an engine for progress, added market efficiency will result from increase in financialization through the development of more complex, [blockchain](https://web3.lifeitself.us/concepts/blockchain)-based [financial products](https://web3.lifeitself.us/concepts/financial-asset) (ranging from better payment rails to more efficient clearing systems).

This position assumes that c[apitalism](https://web3.lifeitself.us/concepts/capitalism) is net positive in the world, and a fairer, more efficient and transparent economy benefits everyone.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation of this claim is that “innovative” blockchain-based financial instruments and financial services would introduce an unacceptable amount of risk into the markets.

# Aspiration 2: A fairer and freer society 


## Claim: The state can and should be hollowed out and blockchain technology can facilitate this


### Description

This claim argues that states are no longer desirable and that blockchain technology can be used to hollow out the state and replace its functions. Advocates of this claim argue that the internet is the new basis of human life, and, as the internet is a global force, borders should no longer exist. We can replace all legacy functions of the state with software, and the public goods that states once supported can be replaced by either the private sector or blockchain apps.

In addition, modern nation states are too big. Blockchain technology can be used to achieve a more optimal form of human self-organization.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation of this claim is that the entire argument is predicated on the technology being able to do the things they claim. This is falsely treated as a technical reality and an inevitability. States exist for a very good reason. It’s the only structure proven to sustain public goods at a civilization level and be the guarantor of last resort for justice, defense, and monetary issuance.

## Claim: Web3 can facilitate financial inclusion


### Description

This claim argues that cryptocurrencies are a liberatory and egalitarian force that democratizes company formation, lowers barriers, and allows all types of common enterprises that were previously prohibited by law. In addition, crypto can facilitate the financial inclusion of the unbanked.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation of this claim is that financial inclusion via cryptocurrencies is not something to be desired. The crypto markets are currently drastically under regulated, resulting in unacceptable levels of risk to individuals and risk to the broader financial system. Web3 facilitates [predatory inclusion](https://web3.lifeitself.us/concepts/predatory-inclusion): individuals are encouraged to join a volatile and risk-laden marketplace rife with fraud and [asymmetric information](https://web3.lifeitself.us/concepts/asymmetric-information).

In addition, crypto is not a solution for the unbanked, because by its deflationary design it cannot function as a currency. It is therefore unusable as a scalable means for purchasing goods and services

## Claim: Crypto is an anti authoritarian force


### Description

According to this claim, cryptocurrencies provide a privacy-friendly way to store or transfer funds in situations where the state is an adversary – for example, when opposing a repressive regime.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation of this claim is that crypto is not an anti-authoritarian force:



* the malign uses outnumber the benign;
* Bitcoin is traceable;
* for most uses, Bitcoin must be cashed out by those in charge of the monetary supply, most often the very regime the transferor is seeking to circumvent.
* the argument for bitcoin as a hedge against authoritarianism suffers from fallacy of composition and selection bias.

## Claim: Web3 is a means to accelerate the collapse of capitalism and rebuild the global financial system


### Description

This claim is based on the notion that we need to reconfigure the entire global economy and that Crypto can lead us there. Whatever happens on the other side of that financial reconfiguration can only be better than what we currently have.

Advocates argue that we can reinvent money independent of existing power structures and that by doing so we can redefine value and power and achieve a fairer distribution of wealth.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation is that crypto is not a means to accelerate the collapse of capitalism. The crypto ideology is an extension of the neoliberal project that aims to expand the scope and reach of markets to all aspects of human life, a concept often referred to as hyperfinancialization. Since crypto tokens aim to expand the scope of capitalism, they cannot bring about anything but more capitalism.

This claim is based on the notion that Web3 can create an economy where workers/creators can own the means of production. This claim argues that NFTs can facilitate a fairer deal for artists.


### Evaluation of claim

Our analysis is that the economic structure of NFTs is almost identical to that of multilevel marketing schemes. NFTs are a form of predatory inclusion that on average does not liberate artists. Instead most artists will engage in the token sales at a loss, making almost nothing in return.

## Claim: Web3 is a means to dismantle the American tech hegemony


### Description

This claim is premised on the notion that web3 technology can be used to build a decentralized web, which will hand back agency to individual users and will dismantle the monopoly held by companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation of this claim is that Web3 is not a means to disrupt the American tech hegemony.  Blockchain technologies have intractable scalability problems; the only means by which they can scale is by recentralization thereby recreating just another corporate monolith.

# Aspiration 3: Financial Gain Through Financial Liberty


## Claim: Traders and investors can make large financial gains in free, unregulated crypto-markets


### Description

This claim is rooted in the notion that unfettered and unregulated markets are efficient markets; unregulated markets allow companies to do what they're supposed to do, which is maximize returns to shareholders.  As the crypto markets are currently unregulated, those who subscribe to the market fundamentalist ideology argue that these markets therefore have the potential to make those who invest in crypto assets a lot of money. The trader or market fundamentalist view likely represents a majority of interest and activity in crypto. 


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation of this claim is that markets work best when we have abundant public information and minimize fraud and collusion in price formation. Due to the unregulated nature of crypto markets, the markets are rife with fraud and asymmetric information. We also have no idea how much leverage is baked into the system due to the existence of complex financial instruments built upon assets with no fundamental value. The result is inequality (money flows to the sharks), individual and systemic risk, and moral hazard.

# Aspiration 4: Overcoming governance problems 


## Claim: Web3 can revolutionize systems of governance


### Description

This claim argues that blockchain technology can support more democratic, distributed governance and that, by revolutionizing systems of governance, web3 can facilitate cooperative solutions to collective action problems such as climate change.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation of this claim is that while there are examples of DAOs facilitating distributed governance, we are yet to find an example of a DAO solving a collective action problem.

## Claim: Web3 can facilitate the resourcing of public goods and the commons


### Description

This claim argues that web3 can revolutionize the resourcing of public goods and the commons, especially in a voluntary way eg Gitcoin, KlimaDAO.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation is that web3 is yet to achieve this; we have not managed to find an instance of blockchain technology being used to solve the public goods problem.

# Aspiration 5: Innovation and Progress


## Claim: Web3 is an inevitable paradigm shift akin to the Industrial Revolution


### Description

This claim argues that web3 is the path which progress is taking. Historical inventions like the printing press were fraught with concern and risk, and yet humanity survived those paradigm shifts. Blockchain technology is no different than the printing press. We can’t stop runaway phenomena. We simply have to embrace them.


### Evaluation of claim

Our evaluation is that blockchain technology, detached from the sale of crypto assets, has shown no track record of providing benefit for any real world applications. A financial system rooted in blockchain technology is not desirable and the dream of revolutionary systems of governance built on blockchain technology which can support the solving of public goods problems and collective action problems remains unrealized.
